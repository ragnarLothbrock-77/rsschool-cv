## **About Me**
***
Hi everyone! I am beginner web developer from Moscow. I am 30 years old man, radically changed my life one year ago. Before that I did my career in designing sport clothes, but one day I clearly understand necessity of changes in my life. I'v decided to learn web development because it was really interesting for me. 

One year ago I quit my job and got the position in municipal institution. I did a few websites for this institution, and got a lot of experience of coding.

First of all I created a website for culture center ["Zvyozdniy"](https://www.xn----dtbecnbpc6a4koc.xn--p1ai/). It is very simple website with static upload information. After that I was asked to make another one website, for ["Olimp"](https://mbu-olimp.ru/) sport school. At the end I was asked to make website for small museum room ["Na rubezhe"](https://museumnarubezhe.ru/) in our district.

Every websites I'v made is very simple, without using requests to server. All info upload from config files. I made everything myself, design, images, uploading project on hosting and other stuff. I used a React framework in my work. And now I am looking for a job in commercial development. I wont to work in team, get a new experience and develop my knowledge.
